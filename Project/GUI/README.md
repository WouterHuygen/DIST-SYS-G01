# GUI
This application is created with Angular 8. To run this application locally Angular CLI and npm must be installed. Npm is included in the Node.js installation, which can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Angular CLI can be installed from a terminal, once npm has been obtained, with the command `npm install -g angular-cli` (the option -g ensures a global installation, this is not obligatory)
* To install application dependencies run `npm install` in the root directory.
* To start the application at localhost:4200 run `ng serve` in the root directory
